# WTSpam

**F#*& boost sellers! LFG is filled with "WTS Boost"-spam, lets get rid of it.**

Catch as many boost selling spammers from LFG as you can to a list where you can add them to a ignore list that filters their future messages in the LFG-channel.

Use `/wts`, DataBroker-element or the minimap-button to open the list and click the names in the list to add them to the ignore list or remove them from the list.

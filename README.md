# WTSpam

**F#*& boost sellers! LFG is filled with "WTS Boost"-spam, lets get rid of it.**

Catch as many boost selling spammers from LFG as you can to a list where you can add them to a ignore list that filters their future messages in the LFG-channel. Use */wts* or the button with hardcoded placement (sorry for that, I'll fix it in the future) to open the list and click the names in the list to add them to the ignore list or remove them from the list.
